# Agent Governance Platform

This repository contains a prototype outline for a web application that manages AI agents and their workflows. It includes a FastAPI backend and a React-based frontend.

## Getting Started

1. **Backend**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` to start the API server.

2. **Frontend**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies with `npm install` (placeholder since dependencies are minimal).
   - Use `npm run start` to start the development server.

See `docs/architecture.md` for additional details.

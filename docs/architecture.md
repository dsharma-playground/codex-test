# Agent Governance Platform Outline

This project provides a basic outline for a web application that manages and orchestrates AI agents. The goal is to make it easy to configure agents, design workflows, and monitor usage.

## Directories

- **backend/** – FastAPI application exposing APIs for managing agents and workflows.
- **frontend/** – React application for the user interface.
- **docs/** – Project documentation.

## Features

1. **Agent Creation & Configuration** – API endpoints and UI forms to create agents with configurable engines, prompts, and connectors.
2. **Low-Code Workflow Orchestration** – Placeholder for a canvas builder to design workflows.
3. **Engine Agnostic Flexibility** – Abstraction layer planned so different agent engines can be swapped without rewriting logic.
4. **Operational Management & Governance** – Future dashboard for metrics, costs, and auditing.
5. **Integration & Extensibility** – APIs intended for integrating with third-party tools like GitHub or JIRA.
6. **Regulatory Compliance & Security** – Design considerations for encryption and access controls.

This outline provides a starting point for implementing the platform features described earlier.
